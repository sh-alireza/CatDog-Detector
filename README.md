I am going to implement Resnet moel using transfer learning, finetuning the model to predict cats and dogs... then using ONX to convert the code to tflight... 

the data i'm using is in this link: "https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/dogs-vs-cats/data"

Awesome :)))



### To Do List:

1- Download cats and dogs dataset

2- Prepare it for building dataset class

3- Build a dataset class and show a randome image using dataloader

4- Understand the architecture of ResNet model

5- Implement pretrained ResNet model and finetune it

6- Train the model to achive accuracy of more than 90%

7- Save and Test the best model

8- study about ONX and the way it works

9- implemetnation of ONX

10- What is tf-light

11- implementation of tflight

12- convert to tflight

13- compare tf-light and pytorch
